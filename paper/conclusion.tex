\section{Conclusion}

As one of the largest social network populations on the web, it is a fascinating subject of statistical survey. We demonstrate two ways of obtaining a uniform sample of the population for inference, including one that is scalable as Twitter grows further, like Facebook.

Performing classification of tweets, the wily micro-messages of Twitter users, presents a particularly unique inference challenge due to creative words and lack of context. We discuss methods of dealing with the ill-structured text and evaluate 6 classification methods for 3-valued sentiment. We achieved up to 65\% accuracy on a manually labeled sample of tweets. Our techniques can be applied to other social networks and sources of micro-text.
